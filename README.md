# Introduction to OpenMP

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that provides an introduction to using OpenMP for parallelization in Python. The notebook demonstrates how to implement multiprocessing using OpenMP, along with the necessary concepts and examples.

## Repository Contents

- `Introduction_to_OpenMP.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook that covers the basics of OpenMP, including setup, usage, and examples.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this experiment, you will be able to:

- Understand parallelization in Python
- Implement multiprocessing using OpenMP

## Information

OpenMP is an Application Program Interface (API), jointly defined by a group of major computer hardware and software vendors. It provides a portable, scalable model for developers of shared memory parallel applications.

### Key Points

- **OpenMP**: The easiest to use with minimal learning overhead, most key parallel design patterns can be learned with OpenMP.
- **Concurrency**: A condition of a system in which multiple tasks are logically active at one time.
- **Parallelism**: A condition of a system in which multiple tasks are actually active at one time.

## Getting Started

To get started with the notebook, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Necessary Python packages (listed in the `requirements.txt` file)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/Introduction-to-OpenMP.git
    cd Introduction-to-OpenMP
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    or

    ```sh
    jupyter lab
    ```

2. Open the notebook `Introduction_to_OpenMP.ipynb`.

3. Follow the instructions and run the cells in the notebook to learn about and use OpenMP for parallelization in Python.

## Notes

- The notebook contains various examples and use cases for OpenMP. Modify the examples as needed to fit your specific requirements.
